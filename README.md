Julia code for LASSO, group LASSO, and sparse group LASSO solved via proximal gradient descent.

The sparse group LASSO code can be used for mixed frequency data regressions after applying suitable transformations with Legendre polynomials.

The Jupyter notebook contains functions and some Monte Carlo simulations.
